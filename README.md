## Local Development

Clone this repository and run:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll server --watch

Jekyll will watch your project folder for changes.

Now navigate to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to preview the site, and
[localhost:4000/admin](http://localhost:4000/admin) to log into the CMS.
